 ## Victories
 ---------------------------
 My homepage css and the search bar that uses the name of the recipe and if not found there's an error page with a link back to home.

 ## Challenges
 -----------------------------
 Getting the search to work was a challenge in that I was having truoble showing the error. I replaced "err" with "null" in the "if" statement and it worked!

 ## What to do next?
 -------------------------------

 - I would like for the user to be able to create categories for their recipe and add recipes to the categories.
 - User can mark a recipe as favorite and a star appears next to the recipe and can click on favorites tab to view all favorite recipes.
 - fix bugs with CSS.
 - search by keyword and not name of recipe (title).
